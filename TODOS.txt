Stuff to do:

Backend:
1. Figure out how to run a script every 24 hrs
2. Find API for ETH, LTC and integrate into existing collection
3. Deploy

Actually, idk if we need a separate store of data.
To get all: takes ~ 3000 ms
To get single: takes ~ 200 ms

Frontend:
1. Setup fave library (React+Redux/JQuery)
2. Build UI
3. GET collection on first load
4. GET current price, process logic
5. Edge case
